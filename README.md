# MergeMeals
While we actually use PlasticSCM for remote collaboration, I've set up this repository for the purpose of sharing my code with any interested parties.
Most of the scripts are mine, with the exception of MergeManager.cs and TouchManager.cs.

If you are looking for the most complex script in this repository that I've written, that would be OrderManager.cs as outside of the actually merging operations, it does the legwork for all the other operations.

If you're looking for some idea of how I use Scriptable Objects as reusable templates, you should view FoodItems and Level.
